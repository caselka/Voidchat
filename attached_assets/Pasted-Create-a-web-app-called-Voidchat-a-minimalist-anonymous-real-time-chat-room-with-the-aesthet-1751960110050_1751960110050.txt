Create a web app called **Voidchat** — a minimalist, anonymous, real-time chat room with the aesthetic of a public notepad.

Core Features:
1. **Live Chat Stream**
   - All users see the same global message feed.
   - Messages are plain text only.
   - Users are anonymous, with randomly generated "anon" usernames (e.g. anon3721).
   - Messages appear instantly and scroll up like IRC.

2. **Ephemeral Messages**
   - Each message expires and auto-deletes 15 minutes after being posted.

3. **Spam Protection**
   - Rate limit each IP to 1 message every 5 seconds.
   - If 5+ messages are sent in under 10 seconds from the same IP, block them for 5 minutes.
   - Optional: basic profanity filter to flag/remove toxic entries.

4. **Ambient Ads**
   - Every 20 messages, inject one short ambient sponsor message from a stored list.
   - Each sponsor message must follow this format:
     - ✦ Try: “Product Name” – short poetic or reflective line with optional link.
   - Ads are subtle, styled in grey italic text, and link quietly.
   - Ads expire after their sponsor period (daily, weekly, etc.).

5. **Guardian System (Paid Mods)**
   - Users can become a temporary **Guardian** (moderator) by paying.
   - Guardians can:
     - Mute IPs for 10 minutes
     - Flag or delete abusive messages
     - Enable slow mode (10s per message) for 5 minutes
   - Guardian payments: $2/day or $10/week via Stripe (stub out backend if needed).
   - Guardian actions are logged.

6. **User Interface**
   - Clean, full-screen notepad layout.
   - Dark and light mode toggle.
   - Message input bar fixed at the bottom.
   - Messages display in a continuous scroll above.
   - Optional timestamp in light grey beside messages.
   - No user login, no accounts, no email — completely anonymous.

7. **Tech Stack**
   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or lightweight React if needed)
   - Backend: Node.js with WebSocket support (or Replit-compatible equivalent)
   - Storage: Replit DB or Firebase for messages with TTL support

Include:
- `ambient_ads.json` as the rotating ad source
- a basic “Sponsor the Room” page for submitting and paying for ambient ads
- a placeholder for Stripe integration for Guardian payments
